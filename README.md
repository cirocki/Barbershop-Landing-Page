# Barbershop-Landing-Page

## DESIGN

Website concept inspired by the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
I wondered how the website of a murderous barber might look like, if he really exist.
I also tried to combine the dark, bloody atmosphere with the elegance of London.

## CODING

I used some new GSAP 3 features with ScrollMagic JS library.
