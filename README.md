# :scissors: Barbershop Sweeney Todd - landing page

## Website Live

## Design

Website concept inspired by the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
I wondered how the website of a murderous barber might look like, if he really exist.
I also tried to combine the dark, bloody atmosphere with the elegance of London.

## Coding

A bit of fun with pseudo-elements and absolute positioning. I used some new GSAP 3 features with ScrollTrigger plugin.
